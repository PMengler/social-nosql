# Social-NoSQL

## Description

The movitation behind this project was to create a functional backend for a basic social media platform. This project allows users to create a user, add thoughts and reactions to other user's thoughts. This database displays each user's friends, thoughts, and reactions. I learned a lot about how Mongoose and noSQL works and that it is much more straight forward and simple than mySQL.
